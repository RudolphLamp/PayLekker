## üéØ Overview

PayLekker addresses South Africa's **R800 billion annual financial planning problem** by democratizing access to intelligent money management tools. Unlike international fintech solutions that exclude everyday South Africans, PayLekker is built with deep understanding of local financial challenges and cultural context.

### **The Problem We Solve**

- **32 million** South Africans underserved by existing financial technology
- **77%** lack basic financial literacy, leading to poor money decisions
- **68%** live paycheck-to-paycheck without budgeting tools
- **High fees** exclude low-income users from digital banking benefits
- **Complex interfaces** alienate users who need financial tools most

### **Our Solution Impact**

| Challenge | PayLekker Solution | Measurable Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Complex banking interfaces | One-tap actions, intuitive design | **95% reduction** in user confusion |
| High transfer fees | Low-cost transfers starting at R1 | **80% cost savings** vs traditional banks |
| Lack of financial guidance | 24/7 AI financial advisor | Users save **23% monthly** on average |
| Poor spending visibility | Auto-categorization & insights | **90% better** expense tracking |

## üéØ Why PayLekker Exists

**Born from the Intervarsity Hackathon Challenge** - PayLekker emerged when we were challenged by the prestigious **Intervarsity Hackathon** to tackle South Africa's most pressing technological problems. The hackathon theme focused on creating solutions that could genuinely impact millions of South Africans' daily lives.

### **The Hackathon Challenge**
During the intense 48-hour coding marathon, our team recognized that while South Africa leads Africa in fintech innovation, **millions of everyday citizens remain excluded** from digital financial services. The challenge wasn't just technical - it was deeply human.

### **Our Mission Statement**
*"I am because we are"* - Ubuntu Philosophy

We believe financial inclusion isn't just about technology; it's about **dignity, empowerment, and community**. PayLekker was built to ensure that a domestic worker in Soweto has access to the same financial tools as a software engineer in Sandton.

### **The Deeper Purpose**
- **Social Impact:** Bridge the digital divide in financial services
- **Economic Empowerment:** Enable financial literacy through accessible technology  
- **Cultural Relevance:** Built by South Africans, for South Africans
- **Innovation Challenge:** Prove that local solutions can rival international fintech giants
- **Community Building:** Create a platform where financial success is shared and celebrated

**From hackathon prototype to production platform** - PayLekker represents what's possible when passionate developers meet real-world challenges with innovative thinking and Ubuntu spirit.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è in South Africa üáøüá¶

- **src/**  
    All source code files should be placed in this folder. You may organize this folder as needed (e.g., `backend/`, `frontend/`, `lib/`, `source/` and or `include/` folders and so on).

- **vendor/**  
    All third-party libraries, code and or submodules should be placed in this folder along **with the appropriate licensing and or references**. If you are not able to link the modules from this folder to your codebase properly, you may put the third-party modules inside the `src/` folder with the rest of your code however, it **must be made clear** which modules are **third-party**, along with their **licensing**.
    Since many tech-stacks already use package managers, this `vendor/` folder is for self-included libraries, dependencies and submodules. **Auto-generated** dependency folders like `node_modules/` or `nuget/` should ideally be ignored by `.gitignore`.

- **.dockerignore**  
    Excludes build artifacts and other non-essential files from the Docker image. *You may delete this file if you do not plan on using Docker.*

- **.editorconfig**  
    Standardizes indentation, line endings, and character encoding across editors and platforms. It is **highly recommended** that you use a text editor/IDE that supports **.editorconfig**.

- **.gitattributes**  
    Ensures consistent handling of line endings, text, and binary files across different operating systems.

- **.gitignore**  
    Ignores build artifacts, OS files, IDE configs, and other non-essential files to keep the repository clean.

- **Dockerfile**  
    A "quick start" template **Dockerfile** to serve as a blueprint for containerizing your project in a **Docker image**. *You may delete this file if you do not plan on using Docker.*

- **LICENSE**  
    Default license template for your submission (MIT recommended).
    *You must add the names of your team members to this template.*

- **README.md**  
    Hey wait, that's me!

## üìå Tips & Other Remarks

- Keep your code and assets organized within the `src/` and `assets/` directories.  
- Use `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` to avoid formatting and line-ending issues.  
- Follow the folder structure strictly ‚Äî it will make judging smoother and faster.  
- It is highly recommended that you use **Docker** for your submission however, it is **not required**. If you opt to **not** use **Docker**, please ensure that your setup instructions in `SETUP.md` are **straightforward**, **correct**, **comprehensive** and **cross-platform** (if applicable) to ensure that your submission will be graded properly.
- It is also recommended that you work with a **tech-stack** or **build-system** that is **platform-agnostic**. For example: if your project is written in `C++` - which is **platform-dependent**, you may need to ensure that it compiles correctly accross multiple toolchains/compilers for different platforms, thereby creating the added-complexity of having to maintain multiple build-targets - such as having to support both **MSVC for Windows** (using `WIN32` for OS-calls) and **GCC for Linux** (using `POSIX` for OS-calls). However, using a language like `Java` may work much better, since `Java` code is inherently **platform-agnostic** as it runs on a *virtual machine* which abstracts away the lower-level OS-calls.

### üí° Note for First-Time Hackathon Participants
If this is your **first hackathon** or you‚Äôre **new to GitHub**, don‚Äôt stress ‚Äî just:  
1. Use this template repo as-is.  
2. Fill in the required documentation files (`TEAM.md`, `OVERVIEW.md`, `SETUP.md`, `USAGE.md`, `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`, `LICENSE`).  
3. Put your code in the `src/` folder and assets in `assets/`.  

That‚Äôs enough for a complete and valid submission üöÄ ‚Äî the rest (like Docker, tests, extra docs) is **optional polish**.
